# ChessMates

The BACKFEED protocols are aimed at aligning a large but free and uncoordinated group of creators into a coherent collaboration through a smart distribution of value and reputation. As a fun proof of concept (PoC) for our protocols, we implement them in a multiplayer online chess game, allowing a large number of players jointly play a single hand without much of interactions. The PoC goal is to make a group play significantly better than any of the individual in the group. This is an improved, bionic version of crowd wisdom, implementing the principles of stigermy.
