As a fun proof of concept (PoC) for our protocols, we implement them in a multiplayer online chess game, allowing a large number of players jointly play a single hand without much of interactions. The PoC goal is to make a group play significantly better than any of the individual in the group. This is an improved, bionic version of crowd wisdom, implementing the principles of stigermy.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n  at [chessmates.io](http://chessmates.io)\r\n  \r\n  ![in the making](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Backfeed/ChessMates/master/screenshot.png)\r\n  \r\n## Develop\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Backfeed/ChessMates/blob/master/install.md\">Installation</a>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
